								<h3>How it came to be</h3>
								<p>In a small town, there was a family-owned store that sold all kinds of musical instruments. One day, the owner's son decided to make some modifications to the drums they were selling. With his tinkering, he created a new sound that amazed the customers and the few who heard them. They were soon dubbed as the best sounding drums ever made.

									Word of mouth quickly spread, and musicians from neighboring cities began to visit the small store to buy these magical drums. It wasn't long before famous artists caught wind of the unique sound and started using them in their performances. People were amazed, and the store became famous for selling the greatest drums ever known to man.
									
									As the demand grew, the owner's son started to mass produce the drums while carefully preserving their unique sound. The drums became the store's signature instrument, and people would come from all over the world just to buy them. What started as a small family-owned store, became an international sensation thanks to the passion and innovation of one young man.</p>
