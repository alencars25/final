								<h2>DW</h2>
								<p>ADW Collector's Series 4-Piece Satin Specialty Burnt Toast Fade Shell Pack with Chrome Hardware
									Price $4116.45
									Overview
									DW's flagship line, the Collector's Series, are the original American-made custom drums. For years, drum makers have preferred maple for its resonant tonal qualities. Maple is a traditional shell material that provides low-end punch, warmth and attack. This DW Shell Pack features North American Maple shells with 3-ply reinforcement hoops. Toms 8-13" are 6-ply, while 14" and bigger are 7-ply. Bass drums are also 7-ply.
									
									This shell pack features mounted toms with Vertical Low Timbre (VLT) - a DW special feature which involves arranging grain patterns of shell plies so the outermost and innermost plies run vertically versus the traditional horizontal. This provides less tension on the shell for greater resonance. In addition, the floor tom features X-Shell construction which complements VLT technology through a revolutionary, full vertical shell cross-lamination on the innerplies. The result of these two advancements is a tonally massive drum sound and lowered pitch. Rounding out and refining the low-end of this kit is a kick drum featuring Vertical Low Timbre/Diagonal grain shells (VLX). VLX shells are the lowest grain orientation available from the DW Custom Shop.
									
									It also features DW's patented STM (suspension tom mount) system, which allows drums to vibrate independently, allowing maximum resonance while securely holding the drum in place. Because there are no washers or grommets inhibiting the lug rod receiver, choking is reduced and tuning is as easy as ever.
									
									To give drummers even more control over their sound, DW created its patented True-Pitch rod system. The rods feature 5mm threads rather than the 12/24 that's standard on most other drums. To compare, there is 1 thread every 0.8mm on True-Pitch rods (about 20% more threads), versus 1 thread every 1.05mm on most other drums. The result is a more exacting tuning process.

								<h2>Pearl</h2>
								<p>Pearl Masters Maple Complete 4-Piece Shell Pack Absinthe Sparkle
									Price $1499.99
									Overview
									The road-proven combination of warmth, power and tonal purity that made Masters a legend shines on. Pearl’s innovative EvenPly 6-layer premium maple shell, 2.3mm Superhoops and an improved price tag make Masters a must for the touring pro.
									
									Pearl’s Masters Series has always been synonymous with the best of professional instruments for the touring drummer. In creating new Masters Maple Complete drums, Pearl has crafted a refined representation of Masters’ 25-year history in one total package.
									
									The EvenPly-Six Shells are constructed from six layers of premium North American maple which now incorporate cross-laminated plies of reduced thickness. This 28% thinner shell produces the tonal purity and increased resonance of Pearl’s legendary Masters MMX, while projecting with the vibrant power of the thicker MRX series.
									
									Pearl’s Superior Shell Technology utilizes a proprietary technique for achieving the ultimate air chamber. It begins with select woods chosen for their unique acoustic attributes, milled to precise thickness with overlapping scarf joint seams, for a perfect air-tight fit. The wood plies are saturated with Pearl’s proprietary “AcoustiGlue” that permeates every pore and dries to the exact consistency of the wood for optimum resonance. The plies are formed in high-temperature molds with 1000 PSI of hydraulic pressure to produce perfect drum shells that exhibit superior tone, optimal resonance and extreme strength.
									
									This set features Masters professional hardware including SP30 spurs, LB40 floor tom legs, insulated die-cast bass drum claws and sleek bridge-style CL lugs for reduced shell contact. Masters Maple Complete also features triple-flanged SuperHoop II Hoops on the tom and snares. Lastly, these drums are finished with a lacquer finish and Remo heads.

								<h2>Roland</h2>
								<p>Roland TD-30K V-Pro Series Electronic Drum Kit
									Price $4499.00
									Overview
									For over a decade, Roland's revolutionary V-Drums have lead the industry in expressive sound quality and incredible playability. With the introduction of the SuperNATURAL-powered TD-30K V-Pro Series, the electronic drum set reaches a new pinnacle in drumming performance. SuperNATURAL sounds with Behavior Modeling, along with advanced sensing technology, provides a new level of expressive sound quality and playability, resulting in an instrument that reacts and responds to all the subtleties, nuances, and dynamics of a drummer's technique. In addition, USB audio-playback functionality has been added to expand the performance palette. For the stage or for professional recording, the new V-Pro is truly a complete and natural drumming experience.
									
									TD-30 Drum Sound Module with SuperNATURAL Sounds
									
									Powered by SuperNATURAL sounds and Behavior Modeling, the TD-30KV offers superior sound quality and natural response. From rim shots, rolls, flams, even ghost notes on the snare to dramatic crash hits and sustained cymbal swells, every nuance is accurate and smooth. For spatial depth, a dedicated Ambience fader gives you immediate control over lush room ambience and overhead-microphone simulation.
									
									Immense Know-how and Advanced Sensing Technology
									
									The 12-inch PD-125BK mesh V-Pad for snare drum features Roland's amazing dual-triggering technology, resulting in accurate and even sensing between the head and rim. The PDX-100 10-inch mesh head V-Pad for toms provides a dual-mount option for increased setup versatility.
									
									Natural Triggering with Double Pedal Support
									
									The KD-120BK 12-inch V-Kick Trigger Pad offers fast, natural kick-drum triggering and is compatible with double bass pedals (sold separately). The head tension can be adjusted to get the right feel, and the legs feature rubber tips with hidden spikes that can be pointed downward for more stability.
									
									*Kick pedal not included.
									
									V-Hi-Hat for Realistic Feel
									
									With eyes closed, drummers will think they're playing a regular two-piece hi-hat. But examine the innovative VH-11 floating hi-hat, and you'll see that it's actually comprised of one floating cymbal pad atop a fixed lower base. Great for fast setup and easy transport, the VH-11 mounts on conventional hi-hat stands, and provides a similar playing feel to a two-piece hi-hat.
									
									*Hi-hat stand not included.
									
									V-Cymbals for Crash and Ride
									
									With optimized weight-balance and sensitivity, the V-Cymbal Crash provides accurate triggering and a natural swinging motion and for consistent crash performance, including choke control. The enlarged bow area of the V-Cymbal Ride enhances the playing feel, with accurate three-way triggering for edge, bow, and bell.
									
									Compact, Solid Drum Stand
									
									The MDS-12V drum rack has been specifically designed for the TD-30K. It provides flexible ball clamps for snare and toms, boom/straight options for the cymbal arms, and an internal cable management system for a clean professional look.

								<h2>Tama</h2>
								<p>Tama Imperialstar 8-Piece Double Bass Drum Set with Meinl HCS Cymbals
									Price $1399.99
									Overview
									This Tama Imperialstar 8-piece Drum Set is the most affordable Tama drum kit ever to incorporate so many high-end features.
									
									With over 40 years of experience, Tama knows what drummers really want. Which is why, no matter how long you've been playing the drums, no matter what budget you have to work with, Tama has the set you need, want, and can afford. Every aspect of the modern drum kit was exhaustively examined and reexamined and then improved before it was accepted as part of the Imperialstar design. Which is why, if you start playing Imperialstar now as a beginner, you'll still enjoy playing it when you've achieved pro-status. That's how good these groundbreaking new drums are.
									
									Only Tama Imperialstar comes with a complete set of genuine Meinl HCS cymbals. These high-quality brass cymbals are made in Germany and are sonically matched so they sound great together. They are even lathed for a more refined tonal character. The set includes 14" hi-hats, 16" crash and an 20" ride cymbal.
									
									Tama Drum Shells:100% poplar 6-ply/7.5mm
									
									Poplar wood has been used in making drum shells for over 50 years. It offers a full, warm tone combined with medium attack.
									
									Precise Bearing Edges
									
									A drum's bearing edge is one of the most important components in drum sound. Tama's advanced edge-cutting process provides extremely precise bearing edges-which allow Tama shells to ring openly and fully, and provide a wide range of tuneability, sensitivity, and response.
									
									100% Glued Finishes
									
									Some drum companies only affix their wraps to the drum shell by taping the finish at "selected contact points." At Tama, all wrapped finishes are glued to the shell 100% to eliminate warping, buzzing, or lifting. This process allows the shell to resonate fully and consistently. It's more work, but Tama feels the extra effort is worth it, for a difference you can see and hear.
									
									Original Small Lugs
									
									Imperialstar lugs are 10% smaller than the lugs of Tama's previous Swingstar Series for even greater shell resonance.
									
									Drumheads
									
									Batter-side heads are made of clear 250 microns-thick film for richer tone and greater durability. Ring mufflers on bass drum heads remove the need for additional internal muffling.
									
									Accu-Tune Bass Drum Hoops
									
									A special-formulation hi-tech material offers lighter weight and faster, more stable, tuning than traditional metal hoops. In addition, since Accu-Tune hoops use tension bolts instead of clawhooks and T-rods, head changes and packing up are a breeze.
									
									Spur Brackets
									
									Imperialstar spur bracket features the same look and style as Tama's high-end Starclassic drums and provides maximum durability and stability.
									
									Tom Holder
									
									Tama L-Rod and Omnisphere tom holder systems have received acclaim from drummers for over 25 years. These systems offer easy positioning, maximum flexibility, stability, and greater sound than standard designs which penetrate the shell interior and can inhibit resonance.
									
									Tom Brackets
									
									The eye-bolt structure is rock solid, holding the toms in place securely.
